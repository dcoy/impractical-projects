# Impractical Python Projects
## Written by Lee Vaughn

This is my repo that contains the projects in the No Starch Press book [Impractical Python Projects](https://nostarch.com/impracticalpythonprojects) written by Lee Vaugn.

In order to execute the projects, change into the specific directories and create a virtual environment by running:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # if it exists
```
